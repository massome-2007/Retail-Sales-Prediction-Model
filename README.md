# Retail-Sales-Prediction-Model
Project Overview: We'll build a model to predict daily sales based on features like day of the week, promotional events, and store location. This model can help store management optimize inventory, staffing, and promotions.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection: Gather historical sales data.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features for the model.

Model Training: Train a machine learning model to predict sales.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance.

Insights for Management: Generate actionable insights.

Explanation:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collected sample data with features like date, store location, day of the week, promotional events, and sales.

Performed feature engineering to convert categorical variables to numerical and one-hot encoding.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained a Random Forest Regressor model to predict daily sales.

Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Actionable Insights for Management:

Analyzed feature importances to identify key drivers of sales.

Provided management with insights on the impact of promotional events and store locations.

Key Features:
Random Forest Regressor: Robust machine learning model for regression tasks.

Feature Engineering: Converted categorical features to numerical.

Actionable Insights: Highlighted key features for management decisions.
